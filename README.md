# Brain_Buster
#  Description

Brain Buster is a console-based memory game developed in Python to challenge players’ memory and logic skills. Players are presented with a hidden grid of integers and must uncover matching pairs while minimizing their guesses. The game implements error handling and scoring mechanisms to enhance user experience and track performance.

# Features

	•	Hidden grid with integers masked as “X” for secrecy.
	•	Uncover integer pairs by guessing grid positions.
	•	Tracks player performance with scoring based on the number of guesses.
	•	Includes error handling for invalid inputs.
	•	Object-oriented design for scalability and maintainability.

 # Tools and Technologies

	•	Language: Python
	•	Design: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
 # How to Play

	1.	Run the Python script from your console.
	2.	The game will display a hidden grid (e.g., X X X).
	3.	Enter the coordinates (e.g., row,column) to reveal grid values.
	4.	Match integer pairs with as few guesses as possible.
	5.	The game ends when all pairs are matched, and your score is displayed.
 # Game Design

Key Concepts:

	•	Grid Structure: Designed using a 2D array to store and display hidden integers.
	•	Error Handling: Ensures user inputs are valid (e.g., within grid bounds).
	•	Scoring System: Tracks guesses and determines the player’s efficiency.
	•	Object-Oriented Design:
	•	Modular structure with separate classes for the grid, scoring, and game logic.
